# Update Windows Applications

Update Windows Applications is a convenient script that updates all your Windows applications to their latest version.
You can exclude applications that you don't want to be updated.
Also, you can choose to have all desktop shortcuts (including those generated by during the updating process) deleted.

# Prerequisites

- Using a recent version of Windows 10 or 11.
- Have [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) installed.

## Instructions

1. Configure the `config.toml` file.
1. Execute the `UpdateWindowsApplications.exe` file.
1. A Windows User Access Control dialog will appear, requesting administrator privileges. Click `Yes`.
   (This script requires administrator privileges to run because most application updates need administrator privileges.)
